## WHAT JOURNALISTS ARE MISSING — TOP 80 FINDINGS

### 1. LEON BLACK'S EXTREME SEXUAL VIOLENCE (EFTA02731662 — DANY Investigation)
Internal FBI-Manhattan DA communications (June-July 2023) reveal: A victim "trafficked by Maxwell and Epstein" identified Leon Black. The "2001 sexual assault by Leon Black stood out because of how violent" it was. Description: "Black was very violent, tore her clothes off, bit her vagina, forced sex toys into her." She described him as "looking like Shrek." Her mother confirmed identification from a photo. DANY also "believed she was also abused by Staley." This level of detail was NOT in previous public reporting.

### 2. VICTIM DIARY: FORCED MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND FORCED ABORTION (EFTA02731361)
A victim's handwritten diary describes: "The doctor was different again. I think from Israel. He had kind eyes but didnt speak directly to me. This was different. A shot and those rod like things had a hook and so much pain." An apparent forced abortion: "April 22nd I had no choice. I wasnt ready and she wasnt ready... After so many bonding moments with Jeffrey, Ghislaine, their baby inside me." Also: "6 weeks wasnt even given before being sent back. Punishment for trying to run."

### 3. HOWARD LUTNICK MONEY LAUNDERING ALLEGATION (EFTA02730741)
The FBI NTOC master log contains: "NTOC2020 288hmb01 Alleged Money Laundering by Howard Lutnick via BGC Financial and Cantor Fitzgerald." This was accompanied by a request for UK travel records classified "(U//REL TO USA, GBR)." Howard Lutnick is currently Trump's Secretary of Commerce. This finding has never been publicly reported.

### 4. CHABAD / PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS / RUSSIA-ISRAEL NEXUS (EFTA02730486 / EFTA02730741)
Two separate FBI documents reference: "Chabad's involvement in U.S. Presidential pardon petitions and influences from Russia and Israel on [President]." The first version (EFTA02730486) is heavily redacted; the second (EFTA02730741) reveals the entity as Chabad. This connects Russian and Israeli intelligence interests to the presidential pardon process within the Epstein investigation.

### 5. $1 BILLION TAX AVOIDANCE — THE REAL BLACK-EPSTEIN DEAL (EFTA02731023)
The Senate Finance Committee (Chair Ron Wyden) investigation revealed: Black's 2006 GRAT contained Apollo assets appraised at $189M+. The estimated estate tax savings: "exceeding $1 billion." Black paid Epstein $158M between 2012-2017. Black's family office was Elysium Management LLC. The $1B tax scheme was the core financial purpose of the Black-Epstein relationship.

### 6. MALCOLM GRUMBRIDGE — 150+ MAXWELL SHELL COMPANIES (EFTA02730267)
FBI produced an entire Tactical Intelligence Report on Grumbridge as "Person of Interest for the Ghislaine Maxwell Trial." He set up over 150 companies linked to the Maxwell family, was custodian of 44 Kinnerton St in Belgravia (Maxwell residence), had business ties to Kevin Maxwell through The Hogarth Group, and quit the legal profession in 2020 after being found guilty of "a string of rule breaches."

### 7. BLANKET IMMUNITY FOR UNNAMED CO-CONSPIRATORS (NPA)
The Non-Prosecution Agreement contained "blanket transactional immunity" for not just four named co-conspirators but ANY "potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to" those four. None of the four named had cooperated. This is unprecedented.

### 8. JES STALEY RAPED A VICTIM (EFTA02731082)
SDNY prosecution memo: Epstein directed victim to massage Jes Staley at NYC residence. Staley "forced [victim] to touch his genitals and then raped [victim]." Corroborating messages found between Staley and Epstein.

### 9. ONE RECRUITER BROUGHT ~100 UNDERAGE GIRLS (EFTA02731082)
"Victim 9 estimates that she may have brought as many as one hundred underage girls to Epstein's Palm Beach residence." She became pregnant at age 15. Another recruiter "estimates she brought dozens."

### 10. THE ESCAPE KIT: FAKE PASSPORT, DIAMONDS, CASH
In Epstein's NYC mansion safe: $72,083 cash, 48 individually appraised loose diamonds (1-2.38 carats), an expired Austrian passport with Epstein's photo but issued to "Marius Fortelni" (a real person in Southampton, NY), foreign currency, and an AMEX traveler's check. Defense claimed the passport was for "protection in the event of travel to dangerous areas" as "an affluent member of the Jewish faith." Prosecutors asked if Epstein held foreign citizenship — defense declined to respond.

### 11. HAPSBURG GROUP / MANAFORT CONNECTION
A tip linked Epstein's Austrian passport to "the Hapsburg Group (Manafort, Alfred Gusenbauer and Peter Goldscheider)" — connecting Epstein to the same international political influence operation Paul Manafort was convicted for.

### 12. CPUs SURGICALLY REMOVED BEFORE PALM BEACH SEARCH
"Computer processing units (CPUs) were removed from the house but the computer screens, keyboards, cords, etc. were left behind." Multiple rooms had monitors, keyboards, and cables connected to nothing. An FBI memo: "The missing CPUs were never recovered." Someone was tipped off. A July 2007 email discusses wanting to "get the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein's home prior to the state search warrant as soon as possible."

### 13. CDs LABELED "NUDES 00-24" AND FEMALE NAMES
In a fifth-floor closet at the NYC mansion: a box marked "women/old photos" containing seven compact discs — one marked "nudes 00-24," another "Photographer-- J 03," the rest labeled with female names. All seized.

### 14. FBI DELETED 400 TB OF DATA DURING INVESTIGATION
An FBI forensic examiner stated in February 2020: "They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth)." This while evidence still needed processing.

### 15. 71,000 ZERO-BYTE FILES IN FBI PROCESSING
FBI's own emails reveal: 71,000 documents extracted as zero bytes (empty files), email-to-attachment linking was broken ("if an email says, 'see the attached flight records,' we have no way of linking"), and device-to-folder attribution was lost. Prosecutors: "it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what we're getting."

### 16. MCC SURVEILLANCE: 18 COMPONENTS, ONE DOWNLOAD FAILED
The MCC death investigation seized at least 18 hard drive components from the Nice Vision DVR system. Video covered SHU floor 9 and attorney visit area floor 3 from July 23 to August 10, 2019. Critically: "THIS DOWNLOAD FAILED" on one component. FBI also canvassed for surveillance cameras in the vicinity of MCC.

### 17. "PB GIRLS" BINDER — ORGANIZED VICTIM TRACKING
A search warrant specifically targeted a "binder labeled 'PB Girls'" on Little St. James Island — a physical document tracking Palm Beach victims. Also: a computerized database tracking "availability and proximity" of underage girls in the Virgin Islands.

### 18. SPIEF 2014 USB — RUSSIAN ECONOMIC FORUM CONNECTION
A "SPIEF 2014 Silver USB" was seized from Epstein's property. SPIEF is the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum — Russia's equivalent of Davos. This places Epstein at or connected to the 2014 Russian economic forum.

### 19. $350,000 WIRE TRANSFERS TO CO-CONSPIRATORS AFTER MIAMI HERALD ARTICLES
Two days after publication (Nov 28, 2018), Epstein wired $100,000 to one co-conspirator, then $250,000 three days later to another. "Neither of these payments appears to be recurring." Prosecutors called it "attempting to further influence co-conspirators."

### 20. DAN SNYDER, JIM KIMSEY, GEORGE MITCHELL NAMED BY VICTIM (EFTA02731420)
A victim account (marked "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY") names: Senator George Mitchell ("who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad"), "Mr. Kimsey is deranged" (Jim Kimsey, co-founder of AOL), Dan Snyder "is a pig!" (then-Washington Commanders owner). Also references "Mr. Colgan" and Leon Black in a poem titled "Stopped Dead."

### 21. VICTIM'S TODDLER THREATENED
"When I was listed as a witness in a civil action involving Maxwell, I received a phone call in the middle of the night, threatening my then 2-year old's life if I testified."

### 22. BORIS NIKOLIC — BACKUP EXECUTOR OF EPSTEIN'S WILL
Epstein's will, dated August 8, 2019 (TWO DAYS before death), named Boris Nikolic as successor executor. All property directed to "The 1953 Trust," created the same day. Nikolic was former science advisor to Bill Gates. Darren Indyke was at MCC on August 8 for the will signing.

### 23. BOYS ALSO RECRUITED
An FBI tip (EFTA02730741): A caller "stated that her son recruited not only young girls, but young boys as well." This has received virtually no coverage.

### 24. 15-YEAR-OLD TRIED TO SWIM OFF LITTLE ST. JAMES ISLAND
"A 15-year-old girl attempted to swim off Mr. Epstein's island and escape after she was forced to engage in sex acts." She was captured, and Epstein confiscated her passport. Air traffic controllers in the Virgin Islands "observed Mr. Epstein leaving his private plane in 2018 with girls who looked as young as 11."

### 25. LAWRENCE SUMMERS NAMED AS SUCCESSOR EXECUTOR IN EARLIER WILLS
Before the final will naming Boris Nikolic, earlier Epstein wills named Jes Staley AND Lawrence Summers (Treasury Secretary under Clinton, Harvard president) as successor executors. This connection has been underreported.

### 26. WORK RELEASE: SEX IN SUV WITH MATTRESS
A woman was put on Epstein's "approved driver list" during work release. She "would drive him back to jail at night in a suburban with a mattress in the back. Most nights, she and Epstein would park near the jail and have sex."

### 27. ACOSTA "BELONGED TO INTELLIGENCE" — THEN DENIED UNDER OATH
Told Trump transition team: "I was told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' and to leave it alone." Under formal questioning: "I'm not aware of it... No, and no."

### 28. PEN REGISTERS ON MAXWELL'S PHONE
FBI obtained pen register surveillance (tracking all incoming/outgoing calls) on Ghislaine Maxwell's phone number, with multiple renewals. Also: mail cover surveillance, aerial surveillance, court-authorized intercepts, and TECS silent hit border monitoring.

### 29. MATCHMAKER DATABASE — FBI RECONSTRUCTED SHREDDED DOCUMENTS
Evidence includes a "Box containing Shredded paper" and a "Disk containing images of Matchmaker shred reconstruction." FBI digitally reconstructed what appears to be Epstein's "Matchmaker" database from shredded documents.

### 30. 4,800+ FLIGHTS IN TEN YEARS
American Express card records documented more than 4,800 flights purchased by Epstein in a ten-year period, including hundreds for specific individuals.

Indicted for perjury (EFTA00010103).

### 37. EUGENICS PLAN — 20 WOMEN IMPREGNATED AT ZORRO RANCH (EFTA00018443)
Epstein told scientists about his plan to **"use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm"** — goal: 20 women pregnant at a time at 33,000-sq-ft Zorro Ranch. Also wanted **his head and penis frozen.**

### 44. MCC VIDEO FOOTAGE "INADVERTENTLY" DESTROYED (BOP records)
The BOP **"inadvertently preserved footage showing a different area within MCC"** — not the SHU where Epstein died.

### 47. CPUs DELIBERATELY REMOVED BEFORE POLICE SEARCH (EFTA00007219)
During the 2005 Palm Beach search warrant, **three separate computer stations had monitors, keyboards, mice — but no CPUs.** "All of the cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been."

2019 search of NYC mansion: locked safe contained **"electronic disks with labels that included the words 'Young Miscellaneous Nudes 1' and 'Girl Pics Nude.'"** Also found: **"at least hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of sexually suggestive photographs of nude females, many of whom appear to be underage."**

### 49. TERRAMAR PHONE USED TO LOCATE AND ARREST MAXWELL (EFTA00016356-16358)
FBI used a cell phone subscribed to **"Terramar Project, Inc."** — Maxwell's ocean charity — to track and arrest her. TerraMar had **UBS and Citibank accounts** with Maxwell as signatory.

It contained **entry stamps for France, Spain, UK, and Saudi Arabia** from the 1980s. Defense claimed it was for "personal protection" during Middle East travel due to hijacking fears. The **Austrian Embassy contacted prosecutors** demanding answers. Prosecutors found a real Marius Fortelni who had lived in Saudi Arabia. A separate tip linked the passport to the **"Habsburg Group" (Manafort/Gusenbauer/Goldscheider)**.

Government argued this was **"consistent with the capability to leave the jurisdiction at a moment's notice."** The judge cited these items in denying bail, calling Epstein "a serious risk of flight."

### 53. TEL AVIV TICKET FOR "2ND VALID PASSPORT" RENEWAL (EFTA00008872)
Maxwell's message pad system (April 11, 2005): **"The Tel Aviv ticket was not a fraud. It was to get a renewal for your 2nd valid passport. We're getting a refund for it."** This directly implies Epstein maintained a **second passport renewed through Israeli travel.** In April 2008, Epstein was spotted at the Tel Aviv Hilton "meeting with Israeli scientists" and "taking a tour of military bases with Friends of Israel chairman Benny Shabtai."

### 54. SOUTHERN TRUST: $391M ASSETS, $73.6M TAX FRAUD (GVI Complaint, EFTA00018785-95)

In reality, it **employed only 13 people, 11 in admin roles.** Aggregate income: **$656 million** (2013-2017). GVI: "It is clear that Southern Trust Company did not perform the 'informatics' business represented to the EDC." Epstein was sole owner; Kahn was Treasurer; Indyke was Secretary.

A former island worker tipped: "Bluebeach (old lifeguard stand) on the island should hold some financial records if it wasn't wiped."

### 58. MCC GUARDS SHREDDED "EVERYTHING" AFTER DEATH (EFTA00018131)
A guard at MCC reported that an inmate **brought down "bales of shredded paper"** on August 15-16 (days after death) and said he had been **"asked to shred documents by the BOP after-action team"** and that **"they are shredding everything."** Separately, **all institutional count slips for dates prior to August 10** were "apparently missing." The Hammad Memo (08/14/2019) stated investigators were looking into "efforts to obstruct justice by destroying relevant records at MCC."

Found alongside 7 other storage devices. Combined with the Russian blockchain contact (Masha Drokova, 2017), 15-year-old Russian girl on yacht, and Chabad/Russia/Israel FBI index, this suggests broader Russian connections.

It was a surprise birthday gift from one of his friends and they were from France."** Epstein bragged they were **"12 year olds flown over from France because they're really poor over there, and their parents needed the money."** The witness added: "He was constantly bragging about girls' ages or where he got them from."

Epstein's own bodyguard (Chapter 42, "Relentless Pursuit") testified: **"I worked for him for years and I still don't know who you're dealing with. He knows everybody who's powerful in this world."** Connections not just to local police who were **"definitely in his pocket"** — Epstein **"made very clear that the federal government would never prosecute him."** Chilling incident: "a lawyer was found at the bottom of a swimming pool. Epstein asked him if he thought people would believe it was a suicide." Post-2008: **"As soon as Jeffrey got out of jail, there were girls at his house all the time — the only thing that changed was the target age."**

### 63. 15-YEAR-OLD SWAM OFF ISLAND — PASSPORT CONFISCATED, HELD CAPTIVE (EFTA00016839-40)
USVI AG lawsuit: **"A 15-year-old girl attempted to swim off Mr. Epstein's island and escape after she was forced to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein and others. The girl was found, and held captive on the island after he confiscated her passport."** Air traffic controllers in the Virgin Islands observed Epstein leaving his private plane **"with girls who looked as young as 11"** in 2018.

The GVI complaint reveals Southern Trust Company's **IT manager was actually Epstein's driver in Florida.** An **"executive assistant" lived at 301 E. 66th St, NYC** — an address listed in Epstein's address book as **"Apt. for models."** Southern Trust **falsely affirmed to the EDC that it had no non-resident employees.** Despite having only one IT employee, it reported $50.3M net income in 2013, $67.5M in 2014.

His wife interrupted his police interview and **"recommended he consult an attorney."** Flight manifests were presented to the SDNY Grand Jury.

### 80. DISC FOUND: "MISC. GIRLS NUDE / DINNER — SCIENTISTS" (EFTA00020147-49)
During the NYC mansion search, a disc found in a fifth-floor dresser bore the label **"Misc. Girls Nude/Dinner--Scientists."** A safe on the third floor contained **binders with CDs labeled "Zorro" or "LSJ"** (Little St. James) plus titles with female names. Also found: **"loose polaroid photographs depicting young, nude females who appear to be teenagers."** The disc label directly links exploitation of young women to scientific networking.

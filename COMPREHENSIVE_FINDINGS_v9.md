## WHAT JOURNALISTS ARE MISSING — TOP 20 FINDINGS

### 1. BLANKET IMMUNITY FOR UNNAMED CO-CONSPIRATORS (NPA)
The Non-Prosecution Agreement contained "blanket transactional immunity" for not just four named co-conspirators but ANY "potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to" those four. When questioned, an official admitted: "I understand how it could be read that way." None of the four named co-conspirators had cooperated with the government. This is unprecedented — no witness could recall any other case granting blanket immunity of this scope. Maxwell explicitly claimed NPA immunity in her 2020-2021 criminal case, citing the Cosby precedent.

### 2. JES STALEY RAPED A VICTIM (EFTA02731082)
SDNY prosecution memo: Epstein directed victim to massage Jes Staley at NYC residence. Staley "forced [victim] to touch his genitals and then raped [victim]." Corroborating messages found between Staley and Epstein "around the period when [victim] recalled being [raped]."

### 3. ONE RECRUITER BROUGHT ~100 UNDERAGE GIRLS (EFTA02731082)
"Victim 9 estimates that she may have brought as many as one hundred underage girls to Epstein's Palm Beach residence for massages." Another recruiter "estimates she brought dozens of girls." The US identified 40 victims in Florida alone.

### 4. $350,000 WIRE TRANSFERS TO CO-CONSPIRATORS AFTER MIAMI HERALD ARTICLES
Two days after the Miami Herald published its series (Nov 28, 2018), Epstein wired $100,000 to one NPA-named co-conspirator, then $250,000 three days later to another. "Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or repeating during the approximately five years of bank records." Prosecutors called it "attempting to further influence co-conspirators."

### 5. FBI DELETED 400 TB OF DATA DURING INVESTIGATION
An FBI forensic examiner stated in February 2020: "They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth)." This while Apple items from NY search and Island evidence still needed processing.

### 6. VICTIM'S TODDLER THREATENED
"When I was listed as a witness in a civil action involving Maxwell, I received a phone call in the middle of the night, threatening my then 2-year old's life if I testified." The same victim stated Maxwell could "make others disappear, if she needs to."

### 7. BORIS NIKOLIC — BACKUP EXECUTOR OF EPSTEIN'S WILL
Epstein's will, dated August 8, 2019 (TWO DAYS before his death), named Boris Nikolic as successor executor. All property directed to "The 1953 Trust," created the same day. Nikolic was former science advisor to Bill Gates.

### 8. WORK RELEASE: SEX IN SUV WITH MATTRESS
A woman was put on Epstein's "approved driver list" during work release. She "would drive him back to jail at night in a suburban with a mattress in the back. Most nights, she and Epstein would park near the jail and have sex in the back of the car." Epstein "seemed friendly with the guards."

### 9. "BABY RANCH" — PLANNED TO IMPREGNATE 20 WOMEN AT ZORRO RANCH
Epstein "hoped to seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico ranch." His goal: "20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-square-foot Zorro Ranch." He also "wanted his head and penis to be frozen." Southern Trust Company disclosed engagement in "DNA analysis."

### 10. BILL GATES / NOBEL PRIZE COMMITTEE
Norwegian investigative journalists revealed Epstein "managed to get Bill Gates through the doors of the Nobel Peace Prize committee's leader in 2013." Former UN Assistant SG Terje Rod-Larsen resigned after financial dealings with Epstein revealed.

### 11. LEON BLACK SEXUAL ASSAULT (EFTA02731082)
Epstein directed victim to massage Leon Black at NYC residence. Black "began initiating sexual contact." Another woman "had provided Black with oral sex during the massage." Gratitude America (Epstein charity) received $1M from Black's foundation.

### 12. HARVEY WEINSTEIN DIRECTED VICTIM TO UNDRESS (EFTA02731082)
Victim recalled "Epstein asking her to massage Harvey Weinstein and that during the massage Weinstein directed [victim] to remove her shirt."

### 13. ACOSTA "BELONGED TO INTELLIGENCE" — THEN DENIED UNDER OATH
Told Trump transition team: "I was told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' and to leave it alone." Under formal questioning: "I'm not aware of it... No, and no."

### 14. ALL EPSTEIN'S WEALTH CAME FROM WEXNER (EFTA02731082)
"That misconduct, together with fees that Epstein paid himself, appears to account for VIRTUALLY ALL of Epstein's wealth." Epstein stole "several hundred million dollars" via power of attorney obtained in 1991. Sold himself NYC mansion at "deeply discounted price."

### 15. VICTIM INTIMIDATION SYSTEM
- "Those who help him will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with"
- Private investigators impersonated police officers
- Victim's parent driven off the road by PI (Candor Investigations, Jupiter FL)
- Trump security: "end up as fertilizer for the back nine holes"
- Epstein: "He was threatening to kill and harm other children if I didn't do what he said"

### 16. SURVEILLANCE & COMPUTERS REMOVED BEFORE SEARCH
"Computers appeared to have been removed from Epstein's Palm Beach residence prior to the search." Defense resisted turning them over. 60+ devices later seized included UNIFI surveillance server, HP RAID servers needing hardware recovery, and a hard drive labeled "Woody Allen Archive."

### 17. DEATH INVESTIGATION FAILURES
- Last check on Epstein's tier: 10:30 PM. No one entered until body found at 6:33 AM.
- Guards shopping online for furniture/motorcycles during shift
- Cellmate Tartaglione: "reportedly threatened to kill him" (correction: Epstein reported cellmate threatened HIM)
- BOP Director: "We failed to do that job. Period."
- Crime scene violated — body moved before ME could photograph
- Tartaglione later feared for his life due to staff threats

### 18. DC MADAM CONNECTION
Friend of Jeanne Palfrey (DC Madam) wrote to prosecutors: "She had been arranging to hold a press conference to release names... she was being followed all day the day before she was found dead." Palfrey's mother was "scared whoever murdered her daughter would come back."

### 19. VICTIM NOTIFICATION DELIBERATELY SUPPRESSED
Government specifically instructed line prosecutor "we are not going to talk about it with the victims" before NPA signed. Defense was allowed to review victim notification letters before they went out. Government argued CVRA didn't apply because no indictment — circular reasoning since they chose not to indict.

### 20. BRUNEL'S "SCOUT" DANIEL SIAD
Jean-Luc Brunel described Daniel Siad as "a 'scout' or recruiter of girls and/or women for J. Epstein" in 2016 emails to Stan Pottinger. FBI was aware of "Epstein's use of a modeling agency to assist him in trafficking underage girls into the United States."

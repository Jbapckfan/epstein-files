## 🔴 WHAT JOURNALISTS ARE MISSING

### 1. JES STALEY RAPED A VICTIM (EFTA02731082)
The SDNY prosecution memo states that Epstein directed a victim to provide a massage to Jes Staley at Epstein's New York residence. Staley "forced [victim] to touch his genitals and then raped [victim]." When the victim complained to Epstein, he said "he left it to [victim] and Staley to decide whether to engage in sex." Messages between Staley and Epstein were found "around the period when [victim] recalled being [raped] by Staley during [massage] at Epstein's New York residence."

### 2. LEON BLACK SEXUAL ASSAULT (EFTA02731082)
Epstein directed victim to massage Leon Black at Epstein's NYC residence. Black "began initiating sexual contact." Victim ran out of room. Epstein "laughed it off as a funny incident." Another woman told victim she "had provided Black with oral sex during the massage."

### 3. HARVEY WEINSTEIN DIRECTED VICTIM TO UNDRESS (EFTA02731082)
Victim recalled "Epstein asking her to massage Harvey Weinstein and that during the massage Weinstein directed [victim] to remove her shirt."

### 4. GLENN DUBIN - EXPLICIT DIRECTIVE (EFTA02731082)
Maxwell "explicitly told [victim] that she had to do to Glen what [victim] did for Epstein" — meaning engage in sex acts. Eva Dubin was also present.

### 5. DARREN INDYKE OBSTRUCTION (EFTA02731082)
Epstein's lawyer told victim "if she ever needed help she should not talk to the police." Also brought Epstein computer in jail for "video sex with [victim]."

### 6. COMPUTERS REMOVED BEFORE SEARCH (EFTA02731082)
"Materials from the search warrant executed by the Palm Beach Police Department in 2005 confirm that computers appeared to have been removed from Epstein's Palm Beach residence prior to the search."

### 7. ALL OF EPSTEIN'S WEALTH CAME FROM WEXNER (EFTA02731082)
"Over his years handling Wexner's finances, Epstein stole or otherwise misappropriated several hundred million dollars from Wexner. That misconduct, together with fees that Epstein paid himself for his services to Wexner, appears to account for virtually all of Epstein's wealth."

### 8. ACOSTA INTELLIGENCE CONTRADICTION
- To Trump transition team: "I was told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' and to leave it alone" (EFTA00030181)
- Under formal questioning: "I'm not aware of it... No, and no" (EFTA00009220, p.405)
- Also said couldn't address intelligence "directly because of guidelines"

### 9. HYOID BONE REDACTION DEBATE (EFTA00010417)
Internal DOJ emails show prosecutors debating whether to redact autopsy photos of Epstein's hyoid bone. "The photo of the hyoid bone on page 12 is in fact Epstein's hyoid bone. To the extent we're redacting the closeup photos from page 13, shouldn't we also redact the entire photo on page 12?"

### 10. SURVEILLANCE CAMERA RECORDS (Dec 2025 text)
Defense requested "All surveillance camera records, logs, and orders since June 26, 2019, including warden, captain, lieutenant, and/or supervisory personnel records of broken or malfunctioning surveillance cameras." Government responded they were "not aware of the relevance."

## INTELLIGENCE CONNECTION

**Alexander Acosta** told Trump transition team: "Is the Epstein case going to cause a problem [for confirmation hearings]?" Acosta had been asked. Acosta had explained that he'd cut the non-prosecution deal because he had "been told" to back off, that Epstein was above his pay grade. "I was told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' and to leave it alone," he told his interviewers in the Trump transition, who evidently thought that was a sufficient answer and went ahead and hired Acosta. [Source: EFTA00030181, Daily Beast article forwarded by SDNY prosecutors]

**CONTRADICTION**: Under formal questioning (EFTA00009220 p.405), asked "were you ever made aware that Mr. Epstein was an intelligence asset of some sort," Acosta said: "I'm not aware of it." Asked "Did defense counsel ever say to you that Epstein had that status?" — "Not to my recollection." Then: "I also don't know where press reports from multiple sources — not from multiple sources, but from multiple media outlets that I told someone that he was an intelligence asset. I do not know where that came from." Asked without reservation: "No, and no."

**Robert Maxwell** (Ghislaine's father) — died 1991 mysteriously falling from his yacht "Lady Ghislaine." It was later discovered he had embezzled from employees' pension fund. Known intelligence connections. Trump was listed as guest on Robert Maxwell's yacht in 1989 (EFTA00029524).

Victims were systematically "lent out" to powerful men by Maxwell and Epstein.

For a period of approximately [redacted], they appeared to have been asleep."

"FBI/OIG was told yesterday by BOP that the camera had not been functioning since Thursday. FBI seized 18 hard drives of video from BOP and are analyzing them to confirm whether there was in fact any video."

### Cellmate Removed Despite Staff Direction
"On August 9, 2019, Epstein's cellmate was transferred out of the MCC in a routine, pre-arranged transfer. Despite the MCC's psychological staff's direction that Epstein have a cellmate, NO NEW CELLMATE WAS ASSIGNED to Epstein's cell."

### Barr Moved to "Quell Doubt"
"After Mr. Epstein killed himself, Mr. Barr moved to quell doubt that the department would seek justice. He immediately determined that prison employees and the warden had broken protocol several times. Mr. Epstein's cellmate had been removed."
